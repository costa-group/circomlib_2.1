/*
    The Baby-Jubjub Montgomery elliptic curve defined over the finite field bn128 is given by the equation

    B*v^2 = u^3 + A*u^2 + u, A = 168698, B = 1

    This curve is birationally equivalent to the twisted Edwards elliptic curve

    a*x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d*x^2*y^2, a = 168700 = (A+2)/B, d = 168696 = (A-2)/B

                                    u     u-1                                     1+y       1+y
    via the map (u,v) -> (x,y) = [ --- , ----- ] with inverse (x,y) -> (u,v) = [ ----- , --------- ]
                                    v     u+1                                     1-y     (1-y)*x

    Since a is not a square in bn128, the twisted Edwards curve is a quadratic twist of the Edwards curve
    
    x'^2 + y'^2 = 1 + d'*x'^2*y'^2

    via the map (x,y) -> (x',y') = [ sqrt(a)*x , y ]

    where d' = 9706598848417545097372247223557719406784115219466060233080913168975159366771.
    We will be working with the twisted Edwards form of the Baby-Jubjub curve because the algorithms for adding, doubling
    and multiplying points by a scalar are faster this way.
