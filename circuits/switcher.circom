*** Switcher(): template that receives three inputs: L, R and sel with sel being a binary value, and switchs the value of L and R in case sel == 1, that it returns the values outL and outR such that:
    - If sel == 0 then outL = L and outR=R
    - If sel == 1 then outL = R and outR=L

        - Inputs: sel -> binary value
                         requires tag binary
                  L -> field element
                  R -> field element
        - Output: outL -> field element, if sel == 0 then L, else R
                  outR -> field element, if sel == 0 then R, else L
         
    Example: Switcher()(1, 4, 7) = (7, 4)
